The intention of this project is provide a "safe place" to allow first time or new contributors to make their mark on the open source world and to learn how to contribute. ***All pull requests will be considered***, whether you're contributing to this master repository or the event/project repositories, adding your name to the contributors or fixing my crappy use of the English language. I welcome translations as well.

Projects will include Hacktoberfest and 24pullrequests among others.

## Hacktoberfest is on!

- [Sign up to Hacktoberfest](https://hacktoberfest.digitalocean.com/) first.
- Then head to [our repository](https://github.com/my-first-pr/hacktoberfest-2018) to make your first hacktoberfest 2018 contribution.

## What is Open Source?

If software is open-source, its source code is freely available to its users. Its users – and anyone else – have the ability to take this source code, modify it, and distribute their own versions of the program. The users also have the ability to distribute as many copies of the original program as they want. Anyone can use the program for any purpose; there are no licensing fees or other restrictions on the software. The OSI has a more detailed definition of “open source” on its website.

For example, Ubuntu Linux is an open-source operating system. You can download Ubuntu, create as many copies as you want, and give them to your friends. You can install Ubuntu on an unlimited amount of your computers. You can create remixes of the Ubuntu installation disc and distribute them. If you were particularly motivated, you could download the source code for a program in Ubuntu and modify it, creating your own customized version of that program – or of Ubuntu itself. Open-source licenses all allow you to do this, while closed-source licenses place restrictions on you.

### What is [Hacktoberfest](https://hacktoberfest.digitalocean.com/)?

Hacktoberfest is a global event, that takes place in October, which motivates open source contributors to boost up their contribution. As well as it is a month-long celebration of open source software in partnership with GitHub.

### What is [24 Pull Requests](https://24pullrequests.com/)?

24 Pull Requests is a little project to promote open source collaboration during December. The idea is basically "Send 24 pull requests between December 1st and December 24th", encouraging developers to give back to open source with little gifts of code throughout December.
